TCP - establishes a connection with the
socket that is waiting to accept an incoming request.
it sends its messages in a byte stream, rather than a self enclosed single message.
TCP ensures that messages are delivered correctly.

UDP - The server (the socket) waits to receive a message.
there is no connection established, no handshaking like in TCP.
the client simply sends the message to a target address, and the server's response is the same,
just a message at a target address rather than a connection like TCP
the messages being sent are sent in a self enclosed package rather than a stream of bytes.
UDP isn't reliable and doesnt guarantee that the message will be delivered.
However on localhost or local network packet loss would be very rare.
